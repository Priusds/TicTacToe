# TicTacToe

Implementation of Alpha Go Zero algorithm with application on TicTacToe.

Using requirements.txt or environment.yml you can build an python environment which is able to run the code.

For example if you use conda you can follow this steps:

```console
(base)foo@bar:~$ conda env create -f environment.yml
(base)foo@bar:~$ conda activate pytorch
(pytorch)foo@bar:~$ 
```
Note the environment name is written in the first line of environment.yml, change the first line if you want to rename it.
